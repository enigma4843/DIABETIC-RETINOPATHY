# DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY
In this project, we address the critical issue of precise Diabetic Retinopathy
(DR) diagnosis, a condition often leading to severe vision impairment or
blindness in diabetic patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning models
and innovative image processing techniques, our study focuses on accurate
retinal image segmentation using a U-Net model. This segmentation
method delineates lesions and retinal structures effectively. Subsequently,
Gabor filters are applied for intricate texture pattern extraction, indicative
of diverse retinopathy stages. Integrating MobileNetV2 for feature
extraction and EfficientNetB0 for multi-class classification significantly
enhances the diagnostic accuracy. Our developed system exhibits a
promising 60.10% test accuracy, showcasing its potential in DR diagnosis.
While challenges related to varying severity levels persist, our robust
framework lays the groundwork for future refinements. By amalgamating
sophisticated image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification
techniques, our system provides a solid foundation for accurate and timely
DR assessment. With continuous enhancements, including the
incorporation of more extensive and diverse datasets, our approach holds
the promise to revolutionise DR diagnostics. The integration of cuttingedge
technology into medical practices underscores the transformative
impact of artificial intelligence in the realm of ophthalmology, promising
improved patient outcomes.
